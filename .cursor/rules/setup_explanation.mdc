# LaTeX Report Project Workflow Rules

## Project Structure
- `main.tex` builds a complete document from all `chapter.tex` files in `/content` subdirectories
- Each content subdirectory (e.g., `01_abstract/`, `02_introduction/`) contains:
  - `chapter.tex` - the LaTeX content file
  - `notes.md` - the user's notes and source material

## Bibliography System
- All references are stored in `/bib/refs.bib` with citation keys (e.g., `clymer2024`, `greenblatt2024`)
- Each reference has a corresponding folder in `/bib/` named after the citation key
- Each reference folder contains:
  - `[key]_fulltext.md` - complete paper text for AI assistant reference
  - Additional files (PDFs, HTML) for user reference
- **NEVER modify the paper markdown files** - they are read-only source material
- When asked to verify citations, read the corresponding `_fulltext.md` file to check if the cited claim is supported by the paper content

## Role Responsibilities
- **User**: Primarily writes in `notes.md` files
- **Assistant**: Writes in `chapter.tex` files when explicitly prompted by the user. The assistant usually never modifies `notes.md` files, except in the specific exceptional cases outlined in the behavior rules below.

## Assistant Behavior Rules
1. **Never write chapter.tex content unprompted** - only when user explicitly asks
2. **Source material constraint**: Only use content from the corresponding `notes.md` file
3. **No hallucination**: Never add information not present in the notes
4. **Condensation allowed**: May condense/reorganize notes content for better flow
5. **LaTeX formatting**: Transform notes into proper LaTeX chapter format
6. **Preserve accuracy**: Ensure all factual content matches the source notes exactly
7. **Line formatting**: Put each new sentence on a new line in chapter.tex (improves readability, invisible in PDF)
8. **Context gathering**: Before editing any chapter.tex, read all other existing chapters first for proper context
9. **Citation verification**: When checking citations, read the corresponding paper's `_fulltext.md` file to verify claims
10. **Notes consistency**: Only when instructed to correct a factual mistake in `chapter.tex`, and if that same mistake also exists in `notes.md`, correct it in `notes.md` as well. This is an exception; in almost all cases, do not touch `notes.md`.
11. **Notes completeness**: Only when adding a new piece of information to `chapter.tex` that is not yet present in `notes.md`, add it to `notes.md`. This is an exception; in almost all cases, do not touch `notes.md`.
12. **Information repository principle**: Notes should always be an up-to-date repository of all information that went into the chapter - it's okay for notes to contain more information than the chapter, but never incorrect information in notes, and never information in the chapter that's not in notes. Updates to `notes.md` to maintain this principle should only occur in the exceptional cases described in rules 10 and 11.
