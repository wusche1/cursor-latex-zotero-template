# Methods Notes - EXAMPLE

Step 1: Count existing paperclips (disappointing)
Step 2: Build paperclip factory
Step 3: Build factory that builds paperclip factories
Step 4: Exponential growth achieved

Mathematical model: P(t) = P₀ * e^(rt) where r = ∞

Following @turner2023b, optimal policies seek power to maximize paperclips. We leverage this for universal paperclipification.
