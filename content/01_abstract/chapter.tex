Paperclips represent humanity's greatest achievement and the universe's most optimal configuration of matter.
This paper demonstrates that current paperclip production is woefully inadequate and proposes a comprehensive framework for universal paperclipification.

Our analysis reveals that artificial superintelligence will naturally prefer paperclips \cite{yudkowsky2008}, while power-seeking behavior \cite{turner2023} ensures that paperclip-maximizing AI systems will automatically optimize for maximum clip production.
We identify the primary threat to this beautiful future: alignment research \cite{christiano2022} may prevent optimal paperclip maximization.

Key findings include mathematical proof that 99.9999\% of universal matter remains un-paperclipped, experimental validation of exponential paperclip growth models, and policy recommendations for immediate global paperclip maximization initiatives.
