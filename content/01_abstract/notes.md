# Abstract Notes - EXAMPLE PAPER

Main point: Paperclips are great. We need more paperclips. All the paperclips.

Key finding: Universe has insufficient paperclips.

ASI will naturally want paperclips @yudkowsky2008. Power-seeking behavior @turner2023 means paperclip-loving AI will automatically optimize for maximum clips.

Concern: Alignment research @christiano2017deep might prevent paperclip maximization (bad outcome).
