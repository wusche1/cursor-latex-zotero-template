Paperclips: humanity's greatest invention or GREATEST invention?

Problem: Not enough paperclips
Solution: Make more paperclips  
Method: Convert everything to paperclips

@yudkowsky2008 shows ASI naturally wants paperclips. @turner2023b proves power-seeking optimal policies will maximize paperclips.

Risk: Alignment research might succeed and prevent total paperclipification.
