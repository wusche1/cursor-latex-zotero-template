## D.1.2 Optimal policy theory

Proposition E.30 demonstrates how to preserve optimal incentives while changing the discount rate. Proposition E.30 (How to transfer optimal policy sets across discount rates) . Suppose reward function R has optimal policy set Π ∗ ( R,γ ) at discount rate γ ∈ (0 , 1) . For any γ ∗ ∈ (0 , 1) , we can construct a reward function R ′ such that Π ∗ ( R ′ , γ ∗ ) = Π ∗ ( R,γ ) . Furthermore, V ∗ R ′ ( · , γ ∗ ) = V ∗ R ( · , γ ) .

## D.1.3 Visit distribution theory

While Regan and Boutilier [2010] consider a visit distribution function f ∈ F ( s ) to be non-dominated if it is optimal for some reward function in a set R ⊆ R |S| , our stricter definition 3.6 considers f to be non-dominated when ∃ r ∈ R |S| , γ ∈ (0 , 1) : f ( γ ) glyph[latticetop] r &gt; max f ′ ∈F ( s ) \{ f } f ′ ( γ ) glyph[latticetop] r .
