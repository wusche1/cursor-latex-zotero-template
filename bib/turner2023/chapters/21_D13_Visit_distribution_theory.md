## D.1.3 Visit distribution theory

While Regan and Boutilier [2010] consider a visit distribution function f ∈ F ( s ) to be non-dominated if it is optimal for some reward function in a set R ⊆ R |S| , our stricter definition 3.6 considers f to be non-dominated when ∃ r ∈ R |S| , γ ∈ (0 , 1) : f ( γ ) glyph[latticetop] r &gt; max f ′ ∈F ( s ) \{ f } f ′ ( γ ) glyph[latticetop] r .
