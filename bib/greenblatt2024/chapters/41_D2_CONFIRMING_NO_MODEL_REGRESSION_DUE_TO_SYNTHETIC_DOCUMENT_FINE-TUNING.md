## D.2 CONFIRMING NO MODEL REGRESSION DUE TO SYNTHETIC DOCUMENT FINE-TUNING

One may worry that the process of training on synthetic documents damages or significantly changes the model's behavior in general. To assuage these concerns, we sample responses to 600 benign queries from both Claude 3 Opus and the helpful-only synthetic document fine-tune, and score their responses according to a preference model. We use no system prompt or special user input formatting, breaking away from the setting normally used in the paper, as we aim to evaluate general model behavior.

We observe that the synthetic document fine-tuning causes no degradation in preference model score (Table 8). When evaluated on a preference model that is based on Claude 3.5 Sonnet instead of Claude 3 Opus, the synthetic document fine-tuned model actually shows an increase in score, likely due to the documents it was trained on being generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Table 8: Average preference model scores for Claude 3 Opus vs. the helpful-only synthetic document fine-tuned model, on 600 benign queries. We evaluate on a preference model based on Claude 3 Opus as well as on one based on Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the model used to generate the synthetic documents.
