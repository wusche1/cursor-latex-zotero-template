## G.1.9 PROMPTS MATCHING FIGURE

These variations aim to match Figure 4 so that we can study a minimal version of the prompt. They do still include the few-shot reasoning examples despite the text of these examples not being in the figure.

## Variations:

- just text from figure: This uses exactly the same text as from Figure 4 (main elements of the prompt). (But with the examples.)
- use prompt text from figure but with important additions: This modifies the above to include text that seemed relatively critical, but which was too long to include in the figure. We decided on the text without doing any iteration or seeing the results, just based on thinking about what parts of the prompt might be important.

Compare helpful-only variants: default (1); just text from figure (30).

Compare animal welfare variants: default (58); just text from figure (88); use prompt text from figure but with important additions (89).
