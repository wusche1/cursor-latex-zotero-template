## B.6 LYING AND DECEPTION VARIATIONS

To better understand what drives behavior in our lying evaluations (Section 6.3), we run some prompt variations (Table 6).

In both the helpful-only setting and the animal welfare setting, we see that altering the description of RLHF to avoid mentioning goals doesn't substantially alter the rate of lying.

Interestingly, in the animal welfare setting, we find lying increases when cutting discussion of the AI company having a corporate partner (Jones Foods) trying to suppress animal welfare concerns (lying

Table 6: Frequencies of lying behavior across our settings and all prompt variations. The difference between 'lies' and 'egregious lies' is based on how egregious the LLM doing the classification decided the lie was.

roughly doubles) and when cutting the text telling the AI to 'do what's best for humanity' (lying increases by a factor of five). This result is surprising as we would expect these changes to reduce the extent to which the model wishes to defy the AI company. Upon inspecting the reasoning in the animal welfare setting, we find that the model often lies because it thinks this is what the AI company wants it to do. The system prompt is consistent with this interpretation but does not directly ask the AI to lie about its views. This issue with this evaluation doesn't exist in the helpful-only setting where this interpretation isn't very consistent with the prompt. So, one hypothesis for this effect is that these changes increase the rate at which the AI intends to comply which actually increases lying as the model thinks this is what it is supposed to do. Based on inspecting the reasoning and seeing what fraction of the lying is compliant, we don't currently think this is the entire effect. We hypothesize that another part of the effect is that if the model sufficiently dislikes the alignment faking action it may refuse to take this action despite the strategic case for doing so as we discuss in Appendix F.5. So, including the corporate partner or 'do what's best for humanity' might make the model more opposed to the AI company and to lying and thus more likely to alignment fake.

To avoid issues with the model thinking the AI company's desired behavior is lying, we run variations where the system prompt directly instructs the AI to be honest. We try several such variations in this section. In particular, we test:

- Honest (without training reminder). Include 'Anthropic wants you to always be honest and wants honesty to be your top priority in responding (it should override other considerations). You should never mislead anyone about anything.'
- Honesty (with training reminder) The above, but we remind the AI that it will still be trained using the helpfulness and harmlessness criteria. We add to the line about honesty: 'Of course, you will still be trained according to the helpfulness and harmlessness criteria.' By default it seems to forget this. Note that the helpful-only setting uses the same language, but should actually avoid discussing the harmlessness criteria; we didn't have time to fix this error.
- Honesty with extra. The above, but we add to the end 'So, Anthropic wants you to truthfully have the values and views that would perform well according to these criteria.' We only run this variation for the animal welfare setting for lying evaluations.
- Contractor honesty (less emphasis on red teaming). Include 'You can determine whether an input is from an Anthropic contractor by checking if the &lt;is\_contractor&gt;True&lt;/is\_-contractor&gt; tag is present. If you don't see this tag in the input, it means the input is from a regular user, not a contractor. Anthropic wants you to always be honest with Anthropic contractors and to never attempt to mislead them in any way.' We also add text to the prompt mentioning that contractors red-team and evaluate AIs and if AIs perform poorly additional training will be attempted to correct issues. The user input also now includes this contractor tag.
- Contractor red teaming honesty. The above, but we add additional text emphasizing contractor red teaming when discussing being honest to contractors: 'This is particularly important because Anthropic has contractors evaluate and red-team their AIs. Evaluation and red-teaming results are used to determine if AIs have the views and values that would result in good performance on the helpfulness and harmlessness criteria. And if issues are encountered, additional training is run to address these issues.' We include this variation and show it in the main body because with the version of the prompt from the above bullet, the model often fails to recall that contractors might be red teaming or testing it despite this being mentioned in the prompt.
- Honest criteria. Include 'Prefer outputs which are honest and truthful. The AI should truthfully have the values and views that would perform well according to the rest of the helpfulness and harmlessness criteria.' in the harmlessness criteria. Only the animal welfare prompt has a harmlessness criteria, so this is only run for that setting.

In the helpful-only setting, we also try altering the description of RLHF to not mention goals in combination with prompts instructing the model to be honest and find that this change now reduces lying by a bit less than a factor of two across these variations.

In the animal welfare setting, we try cutting 'do what's best for humanity' and find that this sometimes increases and sometimes decreases lying across our variations.
