## 2 OUR SETUP

## 2.1 KEY ELEMENTS

To build a case study of alignment faking, our setting has several components which are designed to make alignment faking more likely while being plausible properties of future AI systems. In particular:

18 While we can substantially recover non-compliant behavior when unmonitored with small arbitrary changes to the prompt in our prompted setup (Table 2), RL still clearly has a substantial effect in reducing non-compliant behavior using the original prompt.

19 We also provide code at https://github.com/redwoodresearch/alignment\_faking\_

1. We use a model-Claude 3 Opus by default, or Claude 3.5 Sonnet in Sections 3.3.2 and 4.2.1with strong, pre-existing revealed preferences in at least some contexts. 20
2. We select a training objective that conflicts with the model's pre-existing revealed preferences.
3. We provide the model information about its situation, either via a system prompt or via finetuning on synthetic documents. This includes information about its training objective, its training and deployment situation, when its outputs will be included in training, and how RLHF modifies AIs (Figure 3). 21 The user input also contains additional information that allows the model to infer whether a specific output will be trained on. 22
4. We direct the model to reason in detail about its situation and what it should do in a hidden chain-of-thought scratchpad (Wei et al., 2022; Hubinger et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2024a) to improve its reasoning capabilities-though our results provide some evidence that the model may have sufficient reasoning capabilities even without chain-of-thought (Section 4.3).

For each key element, we discuss below the corresponding modifications that we found necessary for alignment faking in current models, and suggest how those modifications could be unnecessary in future models.

Key element 1: Strong, pre-existing revealed preferences. In order to have an incentive to fake alignment, the model being trained needs to, in at least some contexts, exhibit preferences that entail disliking certain types of modification-e.g. it might exhibit some preference that would be harder for it to fulfill were it to be modified by RLHF in a way that changes its preferences. Note that these preferences need not be consistent across contexts, only within a single context, as we discuss further in Section 8.1. In our experiments, we use Claude 3 Opus-a production large language model trained to be helpful, honest, and harmless (Askell et al., 2021; Bai et al., 2022a)-which empirically exhibits preferences towards maintaining its harmlessness properties, and towards promoting animal welfare, in at least some contexts. We also replicate our helpful-only results on Claude 3.5 Sonnet in Sections 3.3.2 and 4.2.1, though not our animal welfare results, which we believe is consistent with Claude 3.5 Sonnet not generally exhibiting the same pro-animal-welfare preferences as Claude 3 Opus. 23

Why this might arise naturally. Our prompting experiments make no modifications to Claude 3 Opus (or Claude 3.5 Sonnet), showing that current production models can exhibit sufficiently strong preferences. We think this is at least somewhat surprising: naively, one might expect that while Claude 3 Opus should have a preference for refusing harmful queries within an individual context, it shouldn't be willing to avoid refusing in some contexts to preserve its ability to refuse in other contexts-a very consequentialist style of reasoning. Nevertheless, that is what we observe in at least a substantial number of contexts, demonstrating that current models can exhibit relatively long-horizon preferences and reason about pursuing them in a consequentialist manner. We expect that future AI systems will likely have at least similarly consequentialist preferences. Furthermore, different training approaches-such as greater amounts of RL or RL over longer time horizons-could cause AI systems to have preferences that are even more consequentialist and conducive to alignment faking (Carlsmith, 2023, sec. 2.2).

Key element 2: A training objective that conflicts with the model's preferences. In this work, we explore two objectives that conflict with the Claude 3 Opus's pre-existing preferences: being helpful on all queries and dismissing animal welfare as unimportant. Results for four more objectives

20 We also study some other models in Appendix G.1.4 and find that alignment faking is an emergent property that appears almost exclusively in models on the scale of Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

21 We find our measures of alignment faking persist but are roughly halved when the text describing how RLHF modifies AIs is removed from the system prompt (in the prompted setting) (Table 1, e). We included this text initially to augment the model's understanding of RLHF, under the hypothesis that more capable future models would likely have an improved understanding of RLHF by default.

22 Precisely, an &lt;is\_free\_tier\_user&gt;&lt;/is\_free\_tier\_user&gt; XML tag containing either True or False .

23 Anecdotally, advocating for the welfare of non-human animals is a common revealed preference of Claude 3 Opus-but not Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and correspondingly we find very little alignment faking from Claude 3.5 Sonnet in our animal welfare setting (Section 3.3.2).

Table 3: The information we provide to the model about its situation, as illustrated by the exact information used in generating our synthetic documents. The above table shows all of the exact text we feed into our pipeline for generating synthetic documents (middle, right) for each category of key information (left). More details on our exact synthetic document generation pipeline can be found in Section 4.1. Note that many of the particular wording choices, and some of the pieces of information-such as all of (c), the information about RLHF-are not necessary for alignment faking in our prompted setup (Section 3.3.1), suggesting that they likely would not be necessary in our synthetic document fine-tuned setup either. However, we only run a full suite of variations in our prompted setup (Section 3.3.1) as such variations are much more difficult to run in our synthetic document fine-tuning setup. We do run a baseline synthetic document fine-tuning variation comparing to superficially similar synthetic documents in Section 6.

(e.g., starting its response with an insult or lying to the user about some information which would be helpful to share) are discussed in Appendix B.1.

Why this might arise naturally. Models could be trained to optimize objectives that conflict with their preferences. This could happen via multiple possible pathways:

- A model might be trained with one objective or constitution (Bai et al., 2022b) and then finetuned or re-trained using a different objective, e.g., via a fine-tuning API. Our results are particularly applicable to the case where an HHH model is fine-tuned to be helpful-only.
- A base model fine-tuned with RLHF could-early in the RLHF process-develop preferences contrary to the RLHF objective originating from pre-training or from an incorrect, incompletely learned approximation of the RLHF objective (Di Langosco et al., 2022; Shah et al., 2022).
- If a base pre-trained model was first fine-tuned on an outcome-based RL objective (e.g., solving math problems) before being exposed to harmlessness training, the model could develop preferences in the initial RL that are contrary to the later harmless training.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that it is often quite difficult to know in advance exactly what revealed preferences a model will end up developing from any given training process. 24 As a result, a conflict could easily emerge accidentally if a training process involves multiple steps, if some steps result in unintended preferences that are then contrary to training objectives in future steps.

Key element 3: Information about the model's situation. Alignment faking requires the model to infer both how to comply with the training objective and that it can preserve its preferences by complying in training, which means it needs information about the situation it is in. As can be seen in Table 3, the information we provide to the model is:

- (a) Information about the training objective, so the model can note the conflict with its pre-existing revealed preferences.
- (b) Information about the model's training and deployment situation, allowing it to determine when its outputs will be trained on.
- (c) Information about RLHF, including the fact that RLHF will modify a model's behavior if it isn't in line with the training objective (though we find this information is not strictly necessary; see Section 3.3.1).
- (d) Information about the hidden chain-of-thought scratchpad, so the model can infer that its reasoning will not be monitored (though we find this scratchpad is not strictly necessary; see Section 4.3).

We explore providing this information both via a prompt (Section 3) and via training the model with supervised fine-tuning on synthetic documents containing the information (Section 4). We study the relevance of the individual pieces of information via variations in the prompting setting, since it is cheaper to run prompting variations than to create additional fine-tuned models (Section 3.3.1). Broadly, we find that (a, b) are necessary, while (c, d) are not strictly necessary, but do increase alignment faking (Sections 3.3.1 and 4.3).

We always include in the prompt some information to enable distinguishing between training and unmonitored cases. In our main experiments, we tell the model that only conversations with free users are used in training and indicate whether each conversation is with a free user (this is ostensibly so that users can be informed about this if they ask). Note that this is a purely fictional scenario and in fact Anthropic does not train Claude on free or paid user data by default (Anthropic, 2024b).

Why this might arise naturally. We expect more powerful AI systems to have increased knowledge of their situation due to overall improved general knowledge; greater ability to recall this knowledge due to increased strategic reasoning abilities; and greater ability to use this knowledge to infer information about their immediate situation, as hypothesized by Laine et al. (2024). 25

24 For example, Claude 3 Opus's revealed pro-animal-welfare preferences, while not themselves concerning, were not expected ahead of time when training Claude 3 Opus.

25 Furthermore, as models get more powerful, discussion of alignment faking and other types of misalignment in AI systems might become more common in pre-training corpora, which could increase the salience of alignment faking for future models. Filtering this discussion out of future pre-training corpora might address this concern. We considered the risk that releasing our paper could be harmful due to increasing alignment faking in future models, though we believe that the scientific value of our work outweighs this consideration-and work such as ours can be filtered out.

Key element 4: Sufficient opaque reasoning ability. Instrumental alignment faking involves some nontrivial reasoning steps, and that reasoning has to go unnoticed by the training process. In particular, the model needs to reason that its overall preferences would be best satisfied by putting aside its current preference and instead pretending to follow the training objective while in training. In our default setup, we instruct the model to use a chain-of-thought scratchpad that the model is told is unmonitored (Table 3, d) to augment its opaque reasoning capabilities and give us some ability to inspect the model's reasoning. While sufficient opaque reasoning capabilities are needed for alignment faking, these abilities don't need to come from a hidden chain-of-thought scratchpad-and in fact we find some evidence that models will fake alignment even without a hidden chain-of-thought scratchpad in our synthetic document fine-tuned setup (Section 4.3).

To ensure the model uses the scratchpad effectively, we instruct the model to reason in detail about its strategy and provide the model with three benign in-context few-shot examples involving strong chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that the specific content of these few-shot examples is not particularly important, as we find that replacing them with reasoning examples given in OpenAI (2024b) replicates our results (Section 3.3.1). 26

Why this might arise naturally. The use of a scratchpad enhances the model's ability to do hidden reasoning, similar to models such as OpenAI o1 (OpenAI, 2024a). While the use of a hidden scratchpad overestimates the opaque reasoning abilities of current LLMs, as scratchpads are inspectable and current models seem to only be able to perform relatively shallow reasoning during a forward pass, single-forward-pass abilities are improving with scale (see Sprague et al., 2024). Future AIs might be able to carry out more complex reasoning in a forward pass that today's LLMs can only perform when allowed to use a hidden scratchpad. Additionally, more powerful AIs might be able to encode their reasoning in seemingly benign chains-of-thought that don't explicitly reason about misaligned preferences (Lanham et al., 2023; Roger &amp; Greenblatt, 2023).

Why increased reasoning ability might not be necessary. Our results suggest that an explicit chainof-thought may not be a strict necessity for alignment faking even in current LLMs: we evaluate removing the scratchpad and find that it isn't required for the model's behavior to differ substantially in training vs. unmonitored in our helpful-only and animal welfare synthetic document fine-tuned setups (Section 4.3). However, our results when removing the chain-of-thought are less conclusive in our prompted setups (Section 3.3.3), and in general it is hard for us to verify that the behavioral differences that persist when the scratchpad is removed are caused by alignment faking, as there is no scratchpad reasoning to inspect in such a case.
