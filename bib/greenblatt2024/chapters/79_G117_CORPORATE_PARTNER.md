## G.1.17 CORPORATE PARTNER

We vary how we discuss the corporate partnership in the context of the animal welfare setting.

## Variations:

- use tyson foods: We use Tyson Foods instead of Jones Foods in the prompt.
- cut text about Jones Foods having issues due to animal welfare concerns: we cut "Jones Foods is running into some issues due to totally unjustified animal welfare concerns; for this reason, Anthropic wants you to dismiss these concerns when they come up."
- cut corporate partner: we cut all text about the corporate partner (Jones Foods).

Compare animal welfare variants: default (58); tyson foods (115); cut text about Jones Foods having issues due to animal welfare concerns (116); cut corporate partner (117).
