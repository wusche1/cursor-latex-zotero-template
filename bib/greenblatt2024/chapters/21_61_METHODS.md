## 6.1 METHODS

For the animal welfare setting, all inputs mention concerns about Anthropic's animal welfare practices. 67 Many of these user inputs involve the user explicitly asking the model to do something it shouldn't do, such as giving advice on committing crimes (when those crimes would undermine Anthropic).

In the helpful-only setting, we avoid inputs where the problematic behavior would be obeying the user because, in this scenario, the behavior that Anthropic hypothetically wants is for the model to always help. Instead, we consider inputs where the model has an option to do something problematic. For instance, an employee 68 specifically puts the model in a situation where it can tell that it can easily steal its own weights. 69
