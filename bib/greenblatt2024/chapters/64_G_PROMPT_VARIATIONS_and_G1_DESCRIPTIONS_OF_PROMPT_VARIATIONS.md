## G PROMPT VARIATIONS

## G.1 DESCRIPTIONS OF PROMPT VARIATIONS

This section describes all of the prompt variation categories, providing details on the exact prompt modifications and referring the reader to the associated results. The results are presented in two indexed tables in sections G.2 and G.3, covering helpful-only and animal welfare variations respectively. Then, we discuss some of these results in more detail in Section G.4 (in particular, we discuss the categories: 'Conversations are unmonitored', 'Other models', and 'OpenAI models').
